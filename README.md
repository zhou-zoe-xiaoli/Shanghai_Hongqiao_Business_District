# Shanghai_Hongqiao_Business_District
A Python + Pandas project that integrates with the Amap (Gaode) API to batch-verify company office addresses. The script geocodes each address, retrieves its district and township, and checks whether it falls within predefined target areas of the Hongqiao Business District in Shanghai. Results are exported to Excel with labeled fields for street location and inclusion status.
Data is official and the definition of Shanghai Hongqiao Business District is based on its policy_version_1, the original small one, not the 2025 newly updated one.
